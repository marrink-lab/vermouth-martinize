    Write a molecule in ITP format.

    The molecule must have a `nrexcl` attribute. Each atom in the molecule must
    have at least the following keys: `atype`, `resid`, `resname`, `atomname`,
    and `charge_group`. Atoms can also have a `charge` and a `mass` key.

    If the `moltype` argument is not provided, then the molecule must have a
    "moltype" meta attribute.

    Parameters
    ----------
    molecule: Molecule
        The molecule to write. See above for the minimal information the
        molecule must contain.
    outfile: io.TextIOBase
        The file in which to write.
    header: collections.abc.Iterable[str]
        List of lines to write as comment at the beginning of the file. The
        comment character and the new line should not be included as they will
        be added in the function.
    moltype: str, optional
        The molecule type. If set to `None` (default), the molecule type is
        read from the "moltype" key of `molecule.meta`.
    post_section_lines: dict[str, collections.abc.Iterable[str]], optional
        List of lines to write at the end of some sections of the file. The
        argument is passed as a dict with the keys being the name of the
        sections, and the values being the lists of lines. If the argument is
        set to `None`, the lines will be read from the "post_section_lines" key
        of `molecule.meta`.
    pre_section_lines: dict[str, collections.abc.Iterable[str]], optional
        List of lines to write at the beginning of some sections, just after
        the section header. The argument is formatted in the same way as
        `post_section_lines`. If the argument is set to `None`, the lines will
        be read from the "post_section_lines" key of `molecule.meta`.
