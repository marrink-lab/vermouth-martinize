class LinkPredicate:
    """
    Comparison criteria for node and molecule attributes in links.

    When comparing an attribute from a link to a corresponding attribute from
    a molecule or a molecule node, the default behavior is to use the equality
    as criterion for the correspondence. Some correspondence, however must be
    broader for the link to be usable. Such alternative criteria are defined
    as link predicates.

    If an attribute in a link is set to an instance of a predicate, then the
    correspondence is defined as the boolean result of the ``match`` method.

    This is the base class for such predicate. It must be subclassed, and
    subclasses must define a :meth:`match` method that takes a dictionary and
    a potential key from that dictionary as arguments.

    Parameters
    ----------
    value:
        The per-instance value that serve as reference. How this value is
        treated depends on the subclass.

    Rule to calculate an interaction parameter in a link.

    This class allows to store dynamic parameters in link interactions. The
    value of the parameter can be computed from the graph using the node keys
    given when creating the instance.

    An instance of this class is first initialized with a list of node keys
    from the link in which it is defined. The instance is latter called
    like a function, and takes as arguments a molecule and a match dictionary
    linking the link nodes with the molecule ones. The format of the dictionary
    is expected to be ``{link key: molecule key}``.

    An instance can also have a format defined. If defined, that format will be
    applied to the value computed by the :meth:`_apply` method causing the
    output to be a string. The format is given as a 'format_spec' from the
    python format string syntax. This format spec corresponds to what follows
    the column the column in string templates. For instance, formating a
    floating number to have 2 decimal places will be obtained by setting format
    to `.2f`. If no format is defined, then the calculated value is not
    modified.

    This is a base class; it needs to be subclassed. A subclass must define an
    :meth:`_apply` method that takes a molecule and a list of node keys from
    that molecule as arguments. This method is not called directly by the user,
    instead it is called by the :meth:`__call__` method when the user calls the
    instance as a function. A subclass can also set the :attr:`n_keys_asked`
    class attribute to the number of required keys. If the
    attribute is set, then the number of keys provided when initializing a new
    instance will be validated against that number; else, the user can pass an
    arbitrary number of keys without validation.
