    Read the secondary structure from a DSSP output.

    Only the first column of the "STRUCTURE" block is read. See the
    `documentation of the DSSP format`_ for more details.

    The secondary structures that can be read are:

    :H: α-helix
    :B: residue in isolated β-bridge
    :E: extended strand, participates in β ladder
    :G: 3-helix (3-10 helix)
    :I: 5 helix (π-helix)
    :T: hydrogen bonded turn
    :S: bend
    :C: loop or irregular

    The "C" code for loops and random coil is translated from the gap used in
    the DSSP file for an improved readability.

    Only the version 2 and 3 of DSSP is supported. If the format is not
    recognized as comming from that version of DSSP, then a :exc:`IOError` is
    raised.

    Run DSSP on a system and return the assigned secondary structures.

    Run DSSP using the path (or name in the research PATH) given by

    In order to call DSSP, a PDB file is produced. Therefore, all the molecules
    in the system must contain the required attributes for such a file to be
    generated. Also, the atom names are assumed to be compatible with the
    'universal' force field for DSSP to recognize them.
    However, the molecules do not require the edges to be defined.

    DSSP is assumed to be in version 2 or 3. The secondary structure codes are
    described in :func:`read_dssp2`.

    that file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    system: System
    executable: str
        Where to find the DSSP executable.
    savefile: None or str or pathlib.Path
        If set to a path, the output of DSSP is written in that file.
    defer_writing: bool
        Whether to use :meth:`~vermouth.file_writer.DeferredFileWriter.write` for writing data
    version: str

    Convert a sequence of secondary structure to martini secondary sequence.

    Martini treats some secondary structures with less resolution than dssp.
    For instance, the different types of helices that dssp discriminates are
    seen the same by martini. Yet, different parts of the same helix are seen
    differently in martini.

    In the Martini force field, the B and E secondary structures from DSSP are
    both treated as extended regions. All the DSSP helices are treated the
    same, but the different part of the helices (beginning, end, core of a
    short helix, core of a long helix) are treated differently.

    After the conversion, the secondary structures are:
    * :F: Collagenous Fiber
    * :E: Extended structure (β sheet)
    * :H: Helix structure
    * :1: Helix start (H-bond donor)
