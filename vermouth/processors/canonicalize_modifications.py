def identify_ptms(residue, residue_ptms, known_ptms):

    Identifies all PTMs in ``known_PTMs`` necessary to describe all PTM atoms in
    ``residue_ptms``. Will take PTMs such that all PTM atoms in ``residue``
    will be covered by applying PTMs from ``known_PTMs`` in order.
    Nodes in ``residue`` must have correct ``atomname`` attributes, and may not
    be missing. In addition, every PTM in must be anchored to a non-PTM atom.

    Parameters
    ----------
    residue : networkx.Graph
        The residues involved with these PTMs. Need not be connected.

    residue_ptms : list[tuple[set, set]]
        As returned by ``find_PTM_atoms``, but only those relevant for
        ``residue``.

    known_PTMs : collections.abc.Sequence[tuple[networkx.Graph, networkx.isomorphism.GraphMatcher]]
        The nodes in the graph must have the `PTM_atom` attribute (True or
        False). It should be True for atoms that are not part of the PTM
        itself, but describe where it is attached to the molecule.
        In addition, its nodes must have the `atomname` attribute, which will
        be used to recognize where the PTM  is anchored, or to correct the
        atom names. Lastly, the nodes may have a `replace` attribute, which
        is a dictionary of ``{attribute_name: new_value}`` pairs. The special
        case here is if attribute_name is ``'atomname'`` and new_value is
        ``None``: in this case the node will be removed.
        Lastly, the graph (not its nodes) needs a 'name' attribute.

    Returns
    -------
    list[tuple[networkx.Graph, dict]]
        All PTMs from ``known_PTMs`` needed to describe the PTM atoms in
        ``residue`` along with a ``dict`` of node correspondences. The order of
        ``known_PTMs`` is preserved.
