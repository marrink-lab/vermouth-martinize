    r"""
    Adds a rubber band elastic network to a molecule.

    The elastic network is applied as bounds between the atoms selected by the
    function declared with the 'selector' argument. The equilibrium length for
    the bonds is measured from the coordinates in the molecule, the force
    constant is computed from the base force constant and an optional decay
    function.

    The decay function for the force constant is defined as:

    .. math::

        \exp^{-r(d - s)^p}

    where :math:`r` is the decay rate given by the 'decay_factor' argument,
    :math:`p` is the decay power given by 'decay_power', :math:`s` is a shift
    given by 'lower_bound', and :math:`d` is the distance between the two atoms
    in the molecule. If the rate or the power are set to 0, then the decay
    function does not modify the force constant.

    The 'selector' argument takes a callback that accepts a atom dictionary and
    returns ``True`` if the atom match the conditions to be kept.

    Only nodes that are in the same domain can be connected by the elastic
    network. The 'domain_criterion' argument accepts a callback that determines
    if two nodes are in the same domain. That callback accepts a graph and two
    node keys as argument and returns whether or not the nodes are in the same
    domain as a boolean.

    Parameters
    ----------
    molecule: vermouth.molecule.Molecule
        The molecule to which apply the elastic network. The molecule is
        modified in-place.
    selector: collections.abc.Callable
        Selection function.
    lower_bound: float
        The minimum length for a bond to be added, expressed in
        nanometers.
    upper_bound: float

        nanometers.
    decay_factor: float
        Parameter for the decay function.
    decay_power: float
        Parameter for the decay function.
    base_constant: float
        The base force constant for the bonds in :math:`kJ.mol^{-1}.nm^{-2}`.
        If 'decay_factor' or 'decay_power' is set to 0, then it will be the
        used force constant.
    minimum_force: float
        Minimum force constant in :math:`kJ.mol^{-1}.nm^{-2}` under which bonds
        are not kept.
    bond_type: int
        Gromacs bond function type to apply to the elastic network bonds.
    domain_criterion: collections.abc.Callable
        Function to establish if two atoms are part of the same domain. Elastic
        bonds are only added within a domain. By default, all the atoms in
        the molecule are considered part of the same domain. The function
        expects a graph (e.g. a :class:`~vermouth.molecule.Molecule`) and two atom node keys as
        argument and returns ``True`` if the two atoms are part of the same
        domain; returns ``False`` otherwise.

        Minimum separation between two atoms for a bond to be kept.
        Bonds are kept is the separation is greater or equal to the value
